## Features

- **Auto-Load Folders**: The application automatically loads the first valid folder from your recent folders list when it starts, providing a seamless experience without requiring manual folder selection.
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient folder scanning with progress indicators for large datasets.
- **Interactive Plotting**: Real-time data visualization with matplotlib integration.
- **Recent Folders**: Remembers your recently opened folders for quick access.
- **Configurable Settings**: User preferences are saved and restored between sessions.

## Auto-Load Feature

The auto-load feature automatically loads the first valid folder from your recent folders list when the application starts. This provides a better user experience by eliminating the need to manually select a folder each time you open the application.

### Controlling Auto-Load

You can control the auto-load behavior through the application menu:

- **File â†’ Toggle Auto-Load**: Check/uncheck this menu item to enable or disable auto-loading
- The setting is automatically saved and will be remembered for future sessions
- When disabled, the application will start without loading any folder, requiring manual folder selection

### How It Works

1. When the application starts, it checks if auto-loading is enabled (default: enabled)
2. If enabled, it looks for the first folder in your recent folders list
3. If the folder exists and is valid, it automatically loads and scans that folder
4. If no valid folders are found, the application starts normally without loading any folder
