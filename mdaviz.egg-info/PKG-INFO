# mdaviz

Python Qt5 application to visualize Bluesky data from tiled server.

## How to run this code?

First said, this software application is pre-release and may contain significant unhandled
bugs.  Please [report any you encounter](https://github.com/BCDA-APS/mdaviz/issues/new) or
feature requests, too.

Suggested installation for developers is to use
`pip` with its *editable* mode:

This project is still in development.
We have [plans for production
release](https://github.com/orgs/BCDA-APS/projects/6).
Until the production release, you should run `mdaviz`
as would a developer by following these instructions:

1. Navigate to a directory where you have similar software projects
2. `git clone https://github.com/BCDA-APS/mdaviz`
   - only need to do this once, assumes you have `git` command
3. `cd mdaviz`
4. `conda env create --force -n mdaviz -f ./env.yml`
   - only need to do this once, assumes you have `conda` command
